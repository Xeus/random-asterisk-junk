# Misc Asterisk/ITP-Redial Stuff

Based on [the ITP Redial class](http://www.itp-redial.com/).

Just a bunch of random junk in here but I wanted to save it for posterity since it's hard to find Asterisk/ruby-agi documentation.

* GottaTakeThis: Android app, press the button on the app and the Asterisk server will call you back in x minutes so you can be rescued from a bad conversation.
* Jeremy Lin stats: dial in and get Jeremy Lin's statline.
* newserver.sh: a nice script for starting up a new linux instance.
* Archer voicemail: dial in and get Archer's prank voicemails.
